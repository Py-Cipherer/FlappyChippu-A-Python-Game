# **Chippu: Out in Wild 🦅🌲**

**Chippu: Out in Wild** is a high-performance, retro-style 2D arcade survival game that pushes the boundaries of traditional side-scrollers. Built with Python and Pygame, it features procedural level generation, a custom dynamic scaling engine, and an innovative cloud-integrated AI system that generates real-time, context-aware dialogue based on your specific playstyle.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🤖 Cloud-Integrated AI Taunt Engine:** The game analyzes your live metrics (flight altitude, flap frequency, and shield usage) and feeds them to an LLM (Groq/Llama 3 or Anthropic API) via background threads. The boss will dynamically mock your specific habits in real-time!
* **⚡ Asynchronous Multi-threading:** Network API calls are handled on secondary threads, ensuring the game maintains a buttery-smooth, locked 32 FPS without any network latency or frame drops.
* **📐 Dynamic Resolution Scaling:** A custom Virtual Surface Scaling Engine maps the internal 400x600 canvas to any physical monitor resolution or aspect ratio, preserving the retro look flawlessly on modern displays.
* **🚀 Engine Optimization & Physics:** Trigonometric calculations for hovering and rotations are pre-calculated using a bespoke `SinCache` module, reducing CPU load by up to 90%.
* **🎨 Advanced OOP Architecture:** Clean, modular code featuring a robust `ChippuAnimator` for complex sprite states, an optimized `ParticleSystem`, and per-pixel alpha transparency logic.
* **💾 Persistence:** High scores are automatically saved and loaded via local JSON storage.
